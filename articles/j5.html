        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, have become one of the most fascinating subjects in modern astronomy. These distant worlds orbit stars far from our sun, and their diversity is beyond what scientists ever imagined. Some exoplanets are rocky, like Earth, while others are gas giants, like Jupiter, but there are many that defy traditional classification. They may orbit their stars in extreme proximity, making them scorchingly hot, or they may exist in the cold outer reaches of their solar systems, far beyond the "habitable zone" where liquid water might exist.</p>
        
        <p>Since the first exoplanet discovery in 1992, scientists have confirmed the existence of thousands of exoplanets. This discovery has fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe and our place within it. With the development of new space-based telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, our ability to detect and study these distant planets has grown exponentially. The search for Earth-like exoplanets in the "habitable zone," where conditions may support life as we know it, continues to be one of the main objectives of exoplanet research.</p>

        <h2>Key Facts About Exoplanets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets have been discovered, and many more candidates are awaiting confirmation. These exoplanets range from gas giants larger than Jupiter to rocky planets smaller than Earth.</li>
            <li>Exoplanets can have a wide range of orbits, with some circling their stars in just a few days, while others take hundreds or even thousands of years to complete an orbit. Some exoplanets, known as "hot Jupiters," orbit extremely close to their stars, making them hotter than any planet in our solar system.</li>
            <li>The discovery of exoplanets has revealed that planetary systems are far more diverse than scientists once thought. Some exoplanet systems have more planets than our solar system, while others have planets with highly elliptical orbits, meaning their distance from their star changes dramatically over time.</li>
            <li>One of the most significant challenges in detecting exoplanets is their distance from Earth. Most exoplanets are too far away to be observed directly, so scientists use indirect methods like the transit method or radial velocity to detect them.</li>
            <li>The search for habitable exoplanets focuses on finding planets in the "habitable zone," the region around a star where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist. However, the exact conditions that make a planet habitable are still the subject of much scientific debate.</li>

        <p>Detecting exoplanets is no easy task. Because exoplanets are so far away and dim compared to their parent stars, scientists have developed several ingenious methods to find them. The most successful of these methods is the transit method, where astronomers measure the slight dimming of a star as an exoplanet passes in front of it. This dimming occurs in regular intervals, allowing scientists to confirm the presence of the planet. Other methods include the radial velocity method, where the gravitational pull of an exoplanet causes a detectable wobble in the motion of its parent star, and direct imaging, which, though rare, allows scientists to capture actual images of exoplanets.</p>

        <h2>Key Questions & Answers</h2>

        <div class="qa">
            <h3>What is an exoplanet?</h3>
            <p>An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. The discovery of these planets has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, showing that planets are a common feature of the universe. While the exoplanets discovered so far have diverse characteristics, scientists are particularly interested in finding planets that might resemble Earth in size and conditions, as these could potentially host life.</p>

        <div class="qa">
            <h3>How are exoplanets discovered?</h3>
            <p>There are several methods used to discover exoplanets, with the transit method and radial velocity method being the most widely used. The transit method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it. The radial velocity method, on the other hand, measures the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. These methods, along with direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, and astrometry, have helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets in the past few decades.</p>

        <div class="qa">
            <h3>Why are exoplanets important?</h3>
            <p>The discovery of exoplanets is significant for several reasons. First, it helps us understand how common planetary systems are in the universe and how they form. Secondly, it opens up the possibility that there are other habitable planets beyond Earth. Some exoplanets are located in the "habitable zone," where conditions may support liquid water – a key ingredient for life. Studying exoplanets helps scientists explore fundamental questions about the origins of life and the potential for life beyond our solar system.</p>
