    <h1>Methods of Exoplanet Detection and Their Characteristics</h1>

    <h2>Methods of Exoplanet Detection</h2>

    <h3>1. Transit Method</h3>
    <p>
        The transit method is based on observing a star's light. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, 
        it blocks some of the light reaching Earth. Scientists can detect a slight dip in the star's brightness during a transit. 
        For example, **Kepler-186f** was discovered using this method.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Radial Velocity Method</h3>
    <p>
        This method uses the Doppler effect. When an exoplanet orbits its star, it causes the star to wobble slightly, 
        which changes the color of its light. An example of this method is the discovery of the exoplanet **51 Pegasi b**.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Direct Imaging</h3>
    <p>
        This method involves using telescopes to directly observe exoplanets. An example is 
        **Fomalhaut b**, which was photographed in 2008.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Microlensing</h3>
    <p>
        The microlensing method is based on the gravitational effect. If an exoplanet passes in front of a more distant star, 
        its gravity can bend the star's light. This allowed the discovery of the exoplanet **MOA-2007-BLG-192-L b**.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Using Space Telescopes</h3>
    <p>
        Space telescopes such as **Kepler** and **TESS** were specifically designed to search for exoplanets 
        and allow for more accurate observations.
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics of Exoplanets</h2>

    <h3>1. Size and Mass</h3>
    <p>
        These parameters determine the planet's gravity and atmospheric conditions. For example, light exoplanets may be rocky, 
        while massive ones may be gas giants.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Orbital Period</h3>
    <p>
        The time it takes for an exoplanet to complete one full orbit around its star. Planets with short orbits, 
        such as hot Jupiters, have high temperatures.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Temperature</h3>
    <p>
        Depends on the distance from the star and the planet's atmosphere. Exoplanets in the habitable zone may have conditions 
        suitable for the existence of liquid water.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Composition</h3>
    <p>
        Exoplanets can be rocky, gaseous, or icy. For example, rocky planets like Earth are composed primarily of solid materials.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Atmosphere</h3>
    <p>
        The composition and density of the atmosphere are critical to understanding the conditions on the planet. 
        The presence of water in the atmosphere may indicate the possibility of life.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Axial Tilt and Orbital Eccentricity</h3>
    <p>
        The axial tilt affects seasonal changes, and the orbital eccentricity determines how much the orbit deviates from a circle.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Presence of Moons</h3>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may have their own moons, which can provide additional information about the planet.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Presence of Rings</h3>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may have ring systems, opening up new horizons in understanding their structure.
