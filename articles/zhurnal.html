        <h2>What are Exoplanets?</h2>
        <p>
            Everything we know about planets typically relates to our Solar System: Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and other familiar planets.
            But in reality, there are many more planets in the universe. These planets are called exoplanets - they orbit other stars outside our Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Simply put:</strong> Exoplanets are similar to Earth but are located far beyond our Solar System and orbit other stars. Our telescopes can observe these stars and discover exoplanets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How do we find exoplanets?</strong> Scientists use special telescopes to detect exoplanets. One of the most famous telescopes is Kepler, which has discovered thousands of exoplanets. Thanks to it, scientists have found worlds where conditions for life may exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did you know?</strong> The first exoplanets were discovered only in 1992! Now we know of more than 5,000 exoplanets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Interesting fact:</strong> Some exoplanets are much larger than Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, while others may be about the same size as Earth.

        <h2>How do scientists search for exoplanets?</h2>
        <p>
            There are several ways scientists find exoplanets. Let's consider two of the most popular methods:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Transit method:</strong> This method is used to find exoplanets that pass in front of their star. When a planet passes in front of a star, the star's light dims slightly because the planet blocks some of the light. This helps scientists determine the planet's size and distance from its star.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> If you stand in front of a flashlight, the light from it dims. Similarly, stars lose some of their light when an exoplanet passes in front of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Radial velocity method:</strong> Planets not only orbit a star, but they also slightly pull it towards themselves. This causes the star to 'wobble'. Scientists can measure this movement of the star to understand that there is a planet nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did you know?</strong> Most exoplanets were found using the transit method!

        <h2>The First Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>
            The first exoplanets were discovered in 1992 around a star called PSR B1257+12. This was a special case because the star turned out to be a pulsar - a dying star emitting radio waves, and the planets around it were in very extreme conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Kepler and new discoveries:</strong> When the Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009, scientists were able to explore a vast number of stars. Kepler observed planets passing in front of their stars, and thousands of exoplanets were discovered with its help. Many of these worlds are at great distances, but thanks to them, scientists now better understand what other planetary systems might look like.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did you know?</strong> Some exoplanets orbit two stars, like in the movie 'Star Wars'! These systems are called binary systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Modern telescopes:</strong> Now scientists are using a new telescope - the James Webb Space Telescope - to learn even more about exoplanets. This telescope can 'see' the atmospheres of exoplanets and help understand whether they can have conditions for life.
