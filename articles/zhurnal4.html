        <h2>Paragraph 4: The Meaning of Exoplanet Names</h2>
        <p>
            Exoplanet names often reflect cultural, historical, or scientific aspects, making them more memorable and interesting to study. Typically, exoplanets are named after their parent stars, but their full names can vary.
        </p>
        <h3>Parent Star Names</h3>
        <p>
            Exoplanets are usually named after the stars they orbit. For example, the planet *Kepler-22b* is named after the star *Kepler-22*.
        </p>
        <h3>Mythology and History</h3>
        <p>
            Many exoplanets are named after mythological or historical figures. For instance, the exoplanet *HAT-P-7b* is named after a mythical character, and *K2-18b* is named after the author C.S. Lewis.
        </p>
        <h3>Scientific Concepts</h3>
        <p>
            Some exoplanets are named after famous scientific concepts or discoveries. For example, the exoplanet *HD 209458b* is known as *Osiris*, linked to the myth of the ancient Egyptian god of fertility.
        </p>
        <h3>Cultural Aspects</h3>
        <p>
            In some cases, exoplanet names may be tied to cultural aspects, such as geography or literature. This helps bring more significance and context to the study of exoplanets.
        </p>
        <h3>Naming Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            The International Astronomical Union (IAU) regulates the naming of exoplanets and periodically holds contests to choose names for newly discovered exoplanets. This helps engage the public in astronomy and make it more accessible.
        </p>
        <h2>The Significance of Numbers in Exoplanet Names</h2>
        <p>
            The numbers in exoplanet names are important as they help astronomers identify planets and their parent stars:
        </p>
        <h3>Identifying the Star</h3>
        <p>
            The first letters of an exoplanet's name, such as "HD", "BD", "Kepler", or "K2", indicate the catalog from which the star was taken. For example, "HD" refers to the Henry Draper Catalogue, and "Kepler" indicates stars discovered by the Kepler space telescope mission.
        </p>
        <h3>Star Number</h3>
        <p>
            The following part, consisting of numbers, indicates the unique number of the star in the corresponding catalog. For example, in the name *HD 209458*, "209458" is the unique number of the star in the Henry Draper Catalogue.
        </p>
        <h3>Letters Indicating the Planet</h3>
        <p>
            After the star's name, a letter may follow, indicating the specific exoplanet orbiting that star. Usually, "b" is used for the first discovered exoplanet, and "c", "d", and so on for subsequent ones. For example, *HD 209458 b* refers to the first exoplanet found around the star *HD 209458*.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>*Kepler-22b*: "Kepler" indicates the star was found by the Kepler mission, "22" is its catalog number, and "b" means it's the first planet around that star.</li>
            <li>*HD 189733 b*: "HD" is the Henry Draper Catalogue, "189733" is the star's unique number, and "b" indicates the first planet around that star.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus, the numbers and letters in exoplanet names help astronomers quickly identify stars and planets, providing a clear and unified naming system.
