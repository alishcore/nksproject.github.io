    <h1>Diversity of Exoplanets</h1>

    <h2>1. Gas Giants</h2>
    <p>
        Gas giants are large planets composed primarily of gases such as hydrogen and helium. 
        They have very thick atmospheres and often lack a solid surface. Examples of gas giant exoplanets include:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>HD 209458 b</strong>: This exoplanet is very similar to Jupiter but is located very close to its star, making its temperature extremely high. 
        Scientists call it a "hot Jupiter" as it differs from the typical gas giants in our Solar System.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Terrestrial Planets</h2>
    <p>
        Terrestrial planets are exoplanets that have a solid surface and may have conditions suitable for life. 
        They are located in the "habitable zone" of their stars, where temperatures may be suitable for the presence of liquid water. 
        An example of such an exoplanet is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Kepler-186f</strong>: It is about the size of Earth and orbits its star in the habitable zone, making it one of the most interesting objects for searching for life outside our Solar System.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Super-Earths</h2>
    <p>
        Super-Earths are exoplanets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. 
        They may have a solid surface and possibly conditions suitable for life. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>GJ 1214 b</strong>: This super-Earth is located in the habitable zone of its star and has interesting atmospheric properties. 
        Scientists believe that it may have oceans and could be suitable for life.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Hot Jupiters</h2>
    <p>
        Hot Jupiters are exoplanets that resemble gas giants but are located very close to their stars. 
        This leads to high temperatures and unusual conditions. An example is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>WASP-12b</strong>: This exoplanet orbits its star in just 26 hours and has a temperature exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Exotic Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets have unique and unexpected characteristics. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>55 Cancri e</strong>: This exoplanet may have an extremely high temperature and may have diamond rain. 
        This makes it one of the most amazing exoplanets known to scientists.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Water Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may contain large amounts of water on their surface. 
        This could be in the form of oceans. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>TRAPPIST-1 d</strong>: This exoplanet is located in the habitable zone of its star and, according to research, may have oceans, 
        making it a candidate for the search for life.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Planets with Exotic Atmospheric Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets have unique atmospheres that differ significantly from Earth's atmosphere. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>K2-18 b</strong>: Scientists have found that this exoplanet may have clouds and water vapor in its atmosphere, 
        which opens up the possibility of the existence of life.
